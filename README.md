# block-game

## The Game
Run `space_holder` to play.

The game is played on a randomly-generated game board made of squares of four different colors,
such as the following:

`another space holder for image`

## Rules
Each player is randomly assigned their own goal to work towards: either to create the largest
connected “blob” of a given color or to put as much of a given color on the outer perimeter as
possible.

There are three kinds of moves a player can do:

• rotating a block (clockwise or counterclockwise),

• reflecting the block horizontally or vertically (i.e. along the x-axis or the y-axis if you imagine
the origin of the axes being place in the center of the block), and

• “smashing” a block (giving it four brand-new, randomly generated, sub-blocks).

After each move, the player sees their score, determined by how well they have achieved their goal.
The game continues for a certain number of turns, and the player with the highest score at the end
is the winner.

## What's next for Block Game
Different types of goals could be added, or computer players can be implemented so that players can challenge themselves against an AI. 
The possibilities are endless ;)
